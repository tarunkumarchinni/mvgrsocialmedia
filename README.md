# mvgrsocialmedia



“MVGR SOCIAL MEDIA” is a mobile application which is used only for the students of MVGR. In this application students are authenticated with their Email ID and password. The main reason behind this application is that the students can know more information about the college and what’s going on – upcoming events, any cultural programs, the student activities, sports, and about the examination complete details. MVGR conducts many events like Flash mobs, KITAB, Blood donation campaign, NSS, Guiding villagers on the name of “LEAD MVGR” and many more. So to the updates, time, place, when, where it is going to happen, the complete details can be updated in this media. This media can be one of the best examples like FACEBOOK and INSTAGRAM. Every department conducts many events – like for example CSE conducts workshops, Civil conducts Sports, ECE conducts Essay Writing competitions, and many other departments have many more ideas. So for this purpose instead of going and announcing or using of notice boards may not reach everyone. So for this purpose students can post the events what the department conducts in this media. Students are also supposed to post the workshops updates or PPT updates which will be conducted in other colleges. So, this is an application which brings entire MVGR STUDENTS INTO ONE COMMUNITY.
